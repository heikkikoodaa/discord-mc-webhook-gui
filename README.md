# Discord Webhook GUI

This is the GUI frontend project for communicating with a Discord webhook that is in my Discord server. From the GUI, a person can send messages to the backend, which then sends that message to the webhook. To be able to send messages or communicate with the webhook, it should be configured in the backend. Here's a link to my backend version of this project if you're interested to take a look: https://github.com/torastrengel/discord-mc-webhook-backend
